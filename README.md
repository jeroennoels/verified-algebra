# Composable algebraic structures and proofs

This package aims to provide:

* Composable specifications for basic algebraic and relational properties: associative and distributive laws, identity and inverse, reflexive and transitive properties, translation invariance -- just to name a few.

* A library of "standard" compositions of the above, defining the usual suspects such as groups, rings, ordered groups etc.  This is augmented with functions that add or forget certain traits.

* A library of algebra theorems and their proofs.

Ultimately the goal is not just to prove classic mathematical theorems.  We specifically aim for something that can be applied to actual computations in Idris.
